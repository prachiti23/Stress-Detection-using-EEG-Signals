# Stress-Detection-using-EEG-Signals
This project detects stress using EEG signals and machine learning in MATLAB, achieving 89.96% accuracy with KNN. Features are extracted using DWT and optimized via Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Models like SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN classify stress levels. Future scope includes real-time monitoring &amp; deep learning models.
